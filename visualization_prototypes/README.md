# Visualization Prototypes

Using the datasets saved in this folder, create prototype data visualizations with the tools of your choice. 

Visualizations particularly desired are found in the [issues](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/open-disclosure/issues) but any visualization can be submitted.

Add the visualizations to this folder or add a link to this README if they are hosted online.

What do the columns in `liccardo_2018.csv` mean?

## Contributions for one individual over time
Run the following.
```python
python contrib_time.py
```
It will generate 3 data files in the `output` directory:
```
contrib.csv
contrib_day.csv
contrib_cumulative_day.csv
```
The last 2 files above can be used in Flourish to create animated line graphs.
Contributions/day over time and published on [Flourish](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1065073/).

Cumulative contributions over the whole campaign on [Flourish](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1065513/).
