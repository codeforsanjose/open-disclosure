        <h1>About Open Disclosure San José</h1>
        <p>
          Open Disclosure San José is an open source, volunteer-developed
          project of Code for San José aimed at making it easier for the average
          voter to see where money is coming from and going to in local
          municipal elections. We believe that it is impractical to expect
          interested voters to sift through hundreds of complex PDF and CSV
          files in order to get an understanding of a campaign&apos;s finances,
          and that voters should have this information in order to make informed
          decisions when they submit their ballots. Therefore, our goal is to
          aggregate and process the information contained in those documents in
          one place in a user-friendly format.
